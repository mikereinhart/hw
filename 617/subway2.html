<!--
The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip. 

There are 3 subway lines:
the N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
the 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place

All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points (for example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th stop on the 6 line.)
